# Digit-recognition-with-Keras

In this example Ive built a simple Keras digit recognition model
Data taken from sklearn.datasets.load_digits()

Here you will find a neural network with following architecture 
2 hidden layers with 100 - 50 neurons (nodes)
activation function - relu

Callback function to stop training once the val_loss no longer improves :
keras.callbacks EarlyStopping()

And graphs displaying Training and Validation loss and accuracy

Please consider giving a star on top right of your screen if you find this helpful

NEXT STEPS 
Deploy on AWS and train model on cloud
